SiTech - Simple Technologies

INTRODUCTION

SiTech is a library to make PHP development easier. Please note that it IS NOT a framework. It's intended use is
as a library to aid in speedy development of enterprise applications. The library can easily be extended to create
a very flexible framework.


NAMING CONVENTION

First off, our naming theme is rather simple, everything is prefixed with SiTech_ then the name of the library
component, then any additional information. For example, our config parser has two backends; XML and INI. For
the INI parser, our file path is SiTech/ConfigParser/INI.php and the class name is SiTech_ConfigParser_INI. This
makes it easy to find within our structure.

We also have SiTech/ConfigParser.php which is a basic class to wrap
our backends. By using SiTech_ConfigParser and specifying the INI type, you will get the INI config parser functionality
from the SiTech_ConfigParser class using some __call(), __set(), and __get() magic. This happens with almost all of our
base classes within the library. Exceptions are sent out in __call() when a method does not exist. We could create a
fatal error like the PHP engine does, but with Exceptions, it allows your program to better handle the error.
